Complexity is a symptom of confusion, not a cause. Jeff Hawkins On Intelligence

Imagine a child: with its neocortex, the input its received coexist with its motory signal, an evolutionary function
both sensory and motory signal flow through the means of an SDR, coexist and creating a downslope potential (if a received vector SDR is present)
the Brain triggers itself the next SDR to get the motory output then compare the new input with the sensory region in the SDR.
With the learnings go on the child grows up to the mind set of a human.

Base on this theory, the brain actually develop first in embryo stage of the human body, 
and the SDR was working on basic function like harmonizing blood pressure, making heart beat, stimilating with chemicals and other subconscious motory function

if the baby instead survive in a forest, raised by wolves
some base Pattern of SDR may also present as it is the core of Earth itself: object recognition, sense of distance
(may come from actual moving to the place and touch the previously perceived object, not only from parallax effect)

How a results-oriented Turing model of intelligence differs, we design the function already. We already put initial potential into the solving function.
and create an higher abstracted model (ANN, CNN) to cope with specialized problem (RNN, CNN, ...)

This theory includes the action exerting nature of the body and the perceiving of the sensory organ, gradually.
Reference can be peeked to which part of the brain was first develop, why do we needs a tail and go straight from the single cellular form

what can be concluded:
	learning and actuating happends simutaneausly
	learning happends at the development of the embryo and includes the subconcious monitoring of body
		It can be checked that the first organs was not synchronised
		The complexity SDR potentials was gradually developed with new input, thus the development of new (motory signal) 
		
		
Insight to project:
	create an encoder based on the Video + text encoder
	Using the above-mentioned approach: create both the output action(text encoder) toghether with the input(video encoder) in the same SDR
	at this point an SDR-like a neocortex show a flash of the brain at a given moment
		Procedure:
			Create Encoder of Video and Text
			Convert simple video and label
			backward inferrence of video to SDR with Video+Text	
				which actually mean Video is related to Text e.g. Smily Face
			Scope of Intelligence:
				Output actuator:
					a library of predefined label {face, smile, round, square, ...}
				Input:
					a serie of video's image ?
