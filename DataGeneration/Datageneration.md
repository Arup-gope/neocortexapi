# Python Image generation script for Video Learning Experiment

# **Idea:**
- The CLA HTM needs a videos to learn. However casual Videos contains a great amount of information and relation with our motory system.  
- The Idea of this image generation is that we use a simple rule, thus also having an infinite possibility of image to make the video. 

The current experiment is a bouncing ball in a square grid, what is expected to see from this experiment is that: 

<em>If the CLA, after the learning of many sequence Sets can figure out a random trajectory of the ball, then the CLA is proved to have a sense of Intelligence for Learning</em>

The images are currently black-white 120x120, No of saved pics is controlled by a count variable.
